# EtInEn Etymological Network Reconstruction

Standalone version of [etinen-etymology](https://github.com/verenablaschke/etinen-etymology) & [etinen-full](https://github.com/jdellert/etinen-full).

This repository currently contains sample data that can be used for trying out new PSL rules in etinen-etymology before introducing them to the full EtInEn system where they can be applied to real data.
